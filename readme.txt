Add XFN (XHTML Friends Network) relationship metadata to WordPress links. Semantic social connections for the block editor.

== Description ==

The XFN Relationship Link Extension seamlessly integrates XFN (XHTML Friends Network) relationship options into WordPress's native link interface. This plugin enhances every block that supports links—including Paragraph, Button, Navigation, List, and more—with comprehensive relationship tagging capabilities through an intuitive collapsible interface.

XFN is a simple way to represent human relationships using hyperlinks. By adding XFN relationships to your links, you can indicate how you're connected to the people and organizations you link to, creating a more semantic and meaningful web.

## Key Features

### Complete XFN 1.1 Specification Support
This plugin implements the full XFN 1.1 specification with all relationship categories:

* **Friendship relationships**: contact, acquaintance, friend
* **Physical relationships**: met (have you met this person?)
* **Professional relationships**: co-worker, colleague
* **Geographical relationships**: co-resident, neighbor
* **Family relationships**: child, parent, sibling, spouse, kin
* **Romantic relationships**: muse, crush, date, sweetheart
* **Identity relationships**: me (link to yourself)

### Triple Interface Integration with Collapsible Design
The plugin provides XFN controls in three convenient locations, all featuring a clean collapsible interface:

* **Floating Toolbar**: Click the "XFN" button in the block toolbar for direct access with expandable XFN section
* **Inspector Controls**: Traditional WordPress panel in the block sidebar with full XFN categorization

## Integration with Popular Blocks

### Button Block

Enhance your site navigation with relationship context using the Inspector Controls. Mark links to your social profiles, partner sites, or affiliated organizations with the organized collapsible interface.

### Paragraph Block (Inline Links)
For inline links within paragraph content, use the collapsible XFN section in the link popover's Advanced area to add relationship context without overwhelming the interface.

## Migration from Other XFN Plugins

If you're migrating from another XFN plugin:

3. **Manual XFN**: Manually entered XFN relationships in rel attributes work immediately

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where can I access XFN relationship options?

XFN controls are available in three locations, all featuring collapsible interfaces:
1. **Floating Toolbar**: Click the "XFN" button in the block toolbar, then expand the XFN section
2. **Inspector Controls**: In the block settings sidebar under "XFN Relationships" panel
3. **Link Advanced Panel**: In the Advanced section of inline link popovers as a collapsible "XFN" section

### Why use a collapsible interface?

The collapsible design keeps the interface clean and uncluttered while providing full access to XFN features:
* **Count badges** show active relationships at a glance
* **Expand only when needed** to reduce visual noise
* **Consistent with WordPress design** patterns
* **Accessible** with proper ARIA states
* **Mobile friendly** with touch-optimized toggles

### What is XFN and why should I use it?

XFN (XHTML Friends Network) is a simple way to represent human relationships using hyperlinks. It adds semantic meaning to your links by describing how you're connected to the people and organizations you link to. This creates a richer, more meaningful web where relationships between people and content are explicit.

### Does the collapsible interface affect accessibility?

No, the collapsible interface enhances accessibility by:
* **Reducing cognitive load** by showing only relevant information
* **Providing proper ARIA states** for screen readers
* **Supporting full keyboard navigation** including expand/collapse
* **Maintaining focus management** when sections open and close
* **Offering visual and semantic cues** about content state

### Does this affect my SEO or page speed?

No negative impact on either. The plugin adds standard HTML rel attributes that search engines understand. The JavaScript only loads in the WordPress editor, not on your public pages. The collapsible interface has no impact on frontend performance.

### Can I use this with Classic Editor?

This plugin is designed for the Gutenberg block editor (WordPress 5.0+). For Classic Editor, you would need a different XFN plugin or manually add rel attributes to your links.

### What happens if I deactivate the plugin?

Your XFN relationships remain in your content as standard rel attributes. They just won't be editable through the collapsible user interface anymore. Your content is never damaged or modified.

### Can I control which sections are expanded by default?

Currently, all collapsible sections start in the collapsed state to maintain a clean interface. We're considering user preferences for default states in future versions.

### Does this work with all themes?

Yes! XFN relationships are standard HTML attributes that work with any theme. The editing interface uses WordPress core components and follows WordPress design patterns for consistency across all admin themes.

### Can I customize the collapsible behavior?

The current version provides the standard collapsible behavior. We're considering customization options for animation speed and default states based on user feedback.

### Is this compatible with page builders?

This plugin works with the native WordPress block editor. Compatibility with third-party page builders depends on whether they use WordPress's standard link interface and support collapsible components.

### How do I see the XFN relationships on my published pages?

XFN relationships appear in the HTML rel attribute of links. You can view them by inspecting the page source or using browser developer tools. They're primarily for semantic markup rather than visual display.

### Can I use this for business relationships?

Absolutely! XFN includes professional relationships (co-worker, colleague) and can be used to indicate business partnerships, vendor relationships, and professional networks. The collapsible interface makes it easy to manage multiple professional relationships.

## Troubleshooting

### XFN options don't appear in floating toolbar

1. **Check block type**: Only blocks that are entirely links (Button, Navigation Link, etc.) show the XFN toolbar button
2. **Verify WordPress version**: Requires WordPress 6.4 or later
3. **Clear browser cache**: Try refreshing the page or clearing browser cache
4. **Check for block selection**: Ensure the block is properly selected

### XFN section won't expand in link popover

1. **Check Advanced section**: XFN options appear when you click "Advanced" in the link popover, then look for the "XFN" toggle
2. **Try clicking the toggle**: The XFN section requires an additional click to expand
3. **Verify in block editor**: Plugin only works with Gutenberg blocks, not Classic Editor
4. **Check browser console**: Look for JavaScript errors that might prevent interaction

### Collapsible sections not animating smoothly

1. **Check browser compatibility**: Ensure you're using a modern, supported browser
2. **Verify CSS loading**: Check that plugin stylesheets are loading properly
3. **Test in incognito mode**: Rule out browser extension interference
4. **Disable other plugins**: Test for plugin conflicts by temporarily disabling other plugins

### Count badges not updating

1. **Try refreshing**: Sometimes a page refresh resolves display issues
2. **Check JavaScript console**: Look for errors that might prevent updates
3. **Test relationship changes**: Make sure you're actually changing relationships
4. **Verify plugin activation**: Ensure the plugin is properly activated

### Relationships not saving properly

1. **Check browser console**: Look for JavaScript errors that might prevent saving
2. **Verify user permissions**: Ensure you have permission to edit the content
3. **Test with default theme**: Temporarily switch to a default WordPress theme
4. **Disable other plugins**: Test for plugin conflicts by temporarily disabling other plugins

### Keyboard navigation issues with collapsible sections

1. **Test tab order**: Use Tab key to navigate to toggle buttons
2. **Try space/enter**: Space or Enter should expand/collapse sections
3. **Use arrow keys**: Arrow keys work within expanded button groups
4. **Check browser settings**: Ensure keyboard navigation is enabled in browser settings

### Screen reader compatibility with collapsible interface

1. **Test with multiple screen readers**: NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver are all supported
2. **Check expansion announcements**: Section state changes should be announced
3. **Verify ARIA states**: All collapsible elements should have proper ARIA attributes
4. **Update screen reader**: Ensure you're using a current version of your screen reader
